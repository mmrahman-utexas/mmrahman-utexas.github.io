excerpt: 'Facial keypoint detection is an important example of a computer vision problem which can be solved effectively by treating the problem as an image regression task and and trainign a CNN network for predicting the image location of the key-points. In this project, I trained a CNN network to predict important facial keypoints given an image of a human face.

**Description:**
Facial keypoint detection is an important example of a computer vision problem which can be solved effectively by treating the problem as an image regression task and and trainign a CNN network for predicting the image location of the key-points. In this project, I trained a CNN network to predict important facial keypoints given an image of a human face.  I did this project as a requirements of graduating from Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree program.

**My contribution:**
Defined and trained a CNN on facial keypoint dataset from "YouTube Faces Dataset" using custom transformation in PyTorch to perform regression task to predict the location of 68 facial keypoints as inspired from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00977.pdf). During inference detected all the faces in an image using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers and predicted the location of 68 facial keypoints on those detected faces using our trained CNN network.
