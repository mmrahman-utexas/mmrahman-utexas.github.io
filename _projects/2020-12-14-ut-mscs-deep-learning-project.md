excerpt: 'We designed an agent to
        play SuperTuxKart, and particularly compete with the AI oracle
        (and other classmate AI agents) in a 2v2 hockey game. Our
        strategy was to maximize puck possession and minimize puck
        distance to the opponent’s goal. Imitation Learning and DAgger
        could not perform sufficiently well when trained using the AI
        oracle of the game. Instead, an internal state controller was built
        and found superior to the AI, where it wins 70% of the time and
        scores an average of 3.1 goals per game when competing in 2v2
        against the AI oracle. Based on supervised learning, a planner
        was trained to detect puck presence and location. Playing 10 2v2
        games, this agent wins 30% of the games and scores an average
        of 1.2 goals per game. Future work can involve training a
        DAgger learner on the internal state controller.'

**Description:**
We designed an agent to
        play SuperTuxKart, and particularly compete with the AI oracle
        (and other classmate AI agents) in a 2v2 hockey game. Our
        strategy was to maximize puck possession and minimize puck
        distance to the opponent’s goal. Imitation Learning and DAgger
        could not perform sufficiently well when trained using the AI
        oracle of the game. Instead, an internal state controller was built
        and found superior to the AI, where it wins 70% of the time and
        scores an average of 3.1 goals per game when competing in 2v2
        against the AI oracle. Based on supervised learning, a planner
        was trained to detect puck presence and location. Playing 10 2v2
        games, this agent wins 30% of the games and scores an average
        of 1.2 goals per game. Future work can involve training a
        DAgger learner on the internal state controller.
